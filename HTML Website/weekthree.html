		<p><u><a>Reflective Statement</a></u></p>
		<p>In order to effectively convey information to students, the website will adopt a formal narrative voice, similar to that of educators in a school setting. This formality is chosen to connect with students and maintain a tone taken seriously, emphasising the importance of the subject matter.</p>
		<p>Additionally, the website's structure will be both navigational and chronological, making it easy for students to explore the content with easy navigation due to its organised layout. This approach will assist their learning, ensuring that they obtain a well-rounded understanding of the digital divide. The website will be approachable so that students can show their opinions concerning the digital divide, perhaps their ideas for solutions to bridge the gap of technology.</p>
