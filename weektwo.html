		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		<p><u>Choices to Consider When Identifying Your Audience(s)</u></p>
		<p><b>Does the Focus of Your Topic Lend Itself to Particular Audiences? What Makes You Think This?</b></p>
		My topic focuses on interactive and engaging learning methods for young pupils. I believe that by implementing innovative approaches, we can ensure that students are voicing their own opinions and ideas surrounding the digital divide. 
		<p><b>Whether You Want to Focus on a Broad or Narrow Audience?</b></p>
		My aim is to focus on a narrow audience, specifically school pupils, who are interested in learning about the digital divide. By providing them with insights and knowledge, I hope to empower them to delve deeper and explore this important issue. 
		<p><b>Whether the Audience is Likely to Have Pre-existing Expectations About the Topic?</b></p>
		There is a significant amount of pre-existing expectations about this topic, thanks to the vast amount of information available online. It may also link to the school syllabus as online learning has been a big part of education for the past few years. 
		<p><b>What Types of Audience Do You Have Regular Access to in Order to Facilitate User Testing?</b></p>
		For reaching out to different age groups, it may be easier to target preteens and teenagers, between the ages of twelve and seventeen. It may be beneficial to gather feedback and insights from their understanding of technological generation.

		<h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Task 4</h5>
		<p><b>Reflective Statement</b></p>
		<p>In creating a website dedicated to educating young students aged 12-17 about the digital divide, my main objectives are to enhance understanding on the causes and effects of the digital divide and explore the potential solutions to this divide. This reflective statement outlines the key points and considerations guiding the creation of this educational platform.</p>
		<p>This website aims to help our young audience grasp the concept of the digital divide, which can be defined as the unequal distribution of access to digital resources and information. This divide isnâ€™t just an issue in developing countries, but can also affect individuals within our own communities, possibly even their peers. Thus, our mission is to raise awareness of this issue and highlight its relevance in our daily lives.</p>
