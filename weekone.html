		<h1>WEEK ONE LAB TASKS</h1>
		<section id="Independent Learning">
		<h2><u>Independent Learning</u></h2>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		<p>Choose a list of topics that could be used to create a website. These must be topics you are passionate about and that will be beneficial for other peoples learning too.</p>
		<p><u>My Topics Include</u></p>
		<p><b>Fake News</b> - It is beneficial for internet users to know how to identify fake news in order for safe navigation on the internet. I gained knowledge on this topic through lectures and labs over my time at university so far. Being able to distinguish between real and fake news can be helpful for a wide audience.</p>
		<p><b>GDPR</b> - GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, is a set of regulations designed to protect all forms of data. Specifically, I intend to explore the rights individuals have to protect their personal data, as well as educate young people on how to protect their own data. This will include an outline of existing standards in place to protect personal information.</p>
		<p><b>Digital Divide</b> - The Digital Divide regards the unequal distribution of resources and information, resulting in access to technology and the internet being limited for certain communities and/or individuals. This is beneficial for a younger audience, who heavily rely on technology, to understand this issue and its impact. Particularly after COVID-19, where technology became a necessity for communication and learning, this highlights the relevance of the digital divide topic.</p>
